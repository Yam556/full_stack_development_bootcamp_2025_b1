                  <p>Adaptive Video Streaming With Dash.js In React</p>
                  <p>
                    HTML video is the de facto element we turn to for embedding
                    video content, but it comes with constraints. For example,
                    it downloads the video file linearly over HTTP, which leads
                    to performance hiccups, especially for large videos consumed
                    on slower connections. But with adaptive bitrate streaming,
                    we can split the video into multiple segments at different
                    bitrates and resolutions.

                  <p>

                    means to solving existing problems in an organization. In
                    this post, weâ€™ll explore how you can build trust for your UX
                    work, gain support, and make a noticeable impact. Part of
                    Measure UX and Design Impact by yours truly.
